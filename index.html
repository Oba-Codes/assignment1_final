                    My Reason For Joining Alt School And What I Hope To Achieve
                </h2>
                <p>Like i mentioned earlier, i've really had a thing for It but never good the chance to learn.</br> but when i heard about alt school, it sounded like a very goog opportunity for me to really learn.</br> And it has been worth it thus far. Though a little challenging, joggling work and missing classes and staying up late to catch up, its been a great experience.</p>
